-Decide What Documents You Support
-What you do: Decide 2 or 3 document types only.
Recommendation:
PDF
DOCX
TXT (optional)


Your system should be able to:
1.	Accept a document file from a user
2.	Save that file somewhere safe
3.	Look at the file type (PDF / DOCX / TXT)
4.	Read the contents based on file type
5.	Convert the document into plain text
6.	Show that text (console or response)
This is called data ingestion in industry

STEP 3: Think About the Upload Flow (Very Important)
1. In your mind, the flow is:
2. User sends a file
3. Backend receives it
4. Backend checks:
5. Is this a supported file?
6. Backend saves it
7. Backend starts reading it

Why this order:
Validation first
Processing later
Prevents crashes and bad data

STEP 5: Reading the Document (Conceptual Only)
For each file type:
PDF
Read page by page
Extract text from each page
Combine all pages into one string

DOCX
Read paragraph by paragraph
Combine paragraphs into one string

TXT
Read line by line
Combine lines into one string

Output:
One plain text string
This string is what AI will use later.

STEP 6: What To Do With Extracted Text
For now:
Just print i
Or return it as response

Why:
You need to see it
You need to verify correctness

Later:
You will store it
You will chunk it
You will embed it

But not now.
